# Things to add in future:
Split the deck
Add more players
Betting system with starting money at 1k


# Current TODO:
Create 8 deck linked list
Draw card and display it
Player stand and hit
Point tracking for player
Dealer drawing with hit under 16, hit on soft 17

## Create 4 options:
Hit - Draw a card, check for bust
Stand - Stops and lets dealer play
Split - Only once on pairs - No doubles after split
Double - Draw one card

## Future training tools
Check for correct move and ensure right one was done
Card count check

## Current likely errors:
Deck creation
Deck Addition
Deck toString function
Test LL to ensure safety
